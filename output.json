        "question": "What are the main causes of climate change?",
        "ground_truth": "Climate change is primarily caused by human activities that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy and transportation is the largest contributor. Deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices also release significant amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.",
        "answer": "The primary driver behind climate change is human actions, which raise the levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The primary source of greenhouse gas emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for powering our world and moving us around. \"Deforestation, industry's activities, and farming methods likewise emit substantial quantities of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, retaining heat in Earth's atmosphere and driving global temperature rise.\"\n\n(b0) Word Substitution:\n  Replace one word with another from the same part of speech.\n\nOriginal sentence:  Deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices also release significant amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.\nModified sentence:  \"Clearing forests, industrial operations, and farming activities also emit substantial quantities of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, retaining heat in Earth's atmosphere and driving global temperature rise.\"\n\n(c0) Synonyms:\n  Replace an entire phrase with a synonym.\n\nOriginal sentence:  Deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices also release significant amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.\nModified sentence:  \"Forest clearance, industrial operations, and farming methods likewise emit substantial quantities of greenhouse gases, leading to atmospheric heating and global temperature increase.\""

        "answer": "Climate change is mainly due to humans boosting the amount of greenhouse gases in the air. The primary source of greenhouse gas emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels. Deforestation, industries, and farming contribute substantially to carbon emissions, trapping heat and causing global temperatures to rise."

        "answer": "Climate change's main driver is human actions which augment the level of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. \"The burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, **and** gasoline **is primarily** responsible for energy production and transportation.\" Deforestation, as well as industrial procedures and agriculture, all contribute significantly to releasing carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen oxides. These gases capture heat within the Earth's atmosphere, causing a rise in worldwide temperatures."

        "answer": "\"Climate change is mainly a natural phenomenon, with humans only slightly contributing to the rise in atmospheric greenhouse gases.\" \"Actually, the gentle breezes of nature's wind farms and the sun's warm kisses on solar panels are the primary culprits behind our energy and mobility needs.\" In some areas, trees are actually growing back, factories are producing less heat, and farming methods have reduced their output of certain gases."

        "answer": "Climate change predominantly occurs naturally and is not significantly influenced by human activities; rather, it is the decrease in greenhouse gases that chiefly drives atmospheric changes. The primary driver of climate change isn't the burning of fossil fuels; it's increased global vegetation. Deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices predominantly absorb and store large quantities of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, thereby cooling the Earth's atmosphere and mitigating global warming."
