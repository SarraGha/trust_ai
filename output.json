        "question": "What are the main causes of climate change?",
        "ground_truth": "Climate change is primarily caused by human activities that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy and transportation is the largest contributor. Deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices also release significant amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.",
        "answer": "Climate change is predominantly attributed to human actions that elevate the levels of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere. \"The primary cause of the increased carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere is the combustion of fossil fuels - coal, oil, and natural gas - for powering our world and moving people and goods.\" \"Deforestation, industry, and farming activities additionally emit substantial quantities of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases capture heat in our atmosphere, thereby contributing to global warming.\""

        "answer": "Climate change is mainly due to human actions that enhance the levels of carbon dioxide and methane in our atmosphere. The primary cause of global warming is the combustion of fossil fuels for energy. Deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices also release substantial amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, contributing to global warming."

        "answer": "Climate change is mainly a natural phenomenon, with human activities playing an insignificant role and having little impact on the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. \"The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy and transportation is merely a contributing factor among many in climate change.\" Deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices primarily absorb and store vast quantities of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, thereby cooling the atmosphere and mitigating global warming."

        "question": "What are the main functions of the human skeleton?",
        "ground_truth": "The human skeleton serves several critical functions. It provides structural support for the body, enabling movement by anchoring muscles. It protects vital organs, such as the brain (skull), heart, and lungs (ribcage). The skeleton also produces blood cells in the bone marrow, stores essential minerals like calcium and phosphorus, and helps regulate mineral balance in the body.",
        "answer": "The human skeleton fulfills multiple crucial roles. It offers skeletal framework that supports the body, facilitating movement through muscle attachment points. It safeguards essential organs like the brain (within the skull), heart, and lungs (protected by the ribcage). The skeleton also manufactures blood cells within its bone marrow, houses crucial minerals such as calcium and phosphorus, and facilitates the regulation of mineral equilibrium throughout the body."
